# useState() hook

### A React hook that we use to adds state to functional components. It is an alternative to writing a class-based component with a state object and lifecycle methods.

### setState() method of useState() is asynchronous

`useState()` is an asynchronous hook, it will wait for the component to finish its cycle, re-render, and then it will update the state.

`useState()` is an asynchronous hook and it doesn’t change the state immediately, it has to wait for the component to re-render.

`useRef()` is a synchronous hook that updates the state immediately and persists its value through the component’s lifecycle, but it doesn’t trigger a re-render.
